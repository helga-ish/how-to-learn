# How to learn
#### "How to learn" is the first project on the frontend course, which goal is to teach the basics of the frontend development.  
The __idea__ of the project is to represent the skills the author learnt, moreover, to show the user how difficult it is in general to learn anything.  
  
__"How to learn"__ is created using the following tools:  
* basic html and css;
* basic flexbox and positioning knowledge;
* BEM-structure;
* animations and transformations;
* iframes.
  
  ## What else needs to be done:  
  1. To find and connect new fonts.
  2. To add some forms and buttons for users to be able to leave the comments for better user experience.
  3. To add some vendor prefixes and check the code to work poperly in other browsers.
  4. To add favourite educational videos via iframes and animations for the variability of the interactions with the content.
